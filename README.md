## How to Run

Start:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start ElasticSearch and Kibana.

**ElasticSearch**: http://localhost:9200
**Kibana**: http://localhost:5601

Both should load...something but will be empty as python has not yet run. If nothing shows up, give it a minute as it takes a bit of time for these services to load.

Running python:

```
docker-compose run pyth python tickets.py --
```

This will load citibike dock data into Elasticsearch at a cadence of once / 30s.

Shutting off:

```
docker-compose down
```
